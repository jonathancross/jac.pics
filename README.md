### JCDSee: a web-based photo viewing / cataloging system written in Perl.
* Production server: http://pics.jonathancross.com
* Dev server: http://test-pics.jonathancross.com

#### What it does:
JCDSee creates an HTML directory listing of any folders it finds so that they can be browsed as a website.  Folders can contain any type of document, but it handles photos especially well by creating multiple sizes, navigation helpers and a slideshow mode for sequential viewing.

#### Features:
* Recognizes 5 general file types: image, folder, music, text and "unknown".
  "unknown" file types can include video, or anything else, but will not
  have an icon unless you provide one manually.
* Will generate & cache thumbnail icons of any jpeg, gif or png files it finds.
* Four image display modes: `list`, `thumb`, `single` and `slide`.
* Fast: Properly handles slow Internet connections via pre-caching images.
* Allows owner to add description of each file / folder.
* Supports dating / numbering of files and folders.
* Short URLs with no configuration.
* Internationalized: supports UTF-8 file / folder names, URLs and descriptions.  See [example of 20+ languages](http://pics.jonathancross.com/list/pics/Other/Language-Cards/) on one page.
* Progressively enhanced: can be used without JavaScript.
* Private: No login, cookies, etc. required.
* Accessible: Can be used with screen readers, keyboard navigation, etc.

#### Requirements:
* Perl with [these modules](jcdsee.cgi#L12) installed.
* An [xml sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps) of all folders on your site. See [example sitemap here](sitemap.xml).  This can be generated with various free tools, but I have not published my code yet.
* [Apache mod_rewrite](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html) for clean urls.

#### URLs:
JCDSee supports clean URLs via `mod_rewrite` (see [.htaccess](.htaccess#L27)).
If you link to a folder, that folder will be loaded in `list` mode by default.
* `http://pics.jonathancross.com/pics/1976/`

You can also specify one of four display modes (`list|thumb|single|slide`) as the root folder to change the way images and icons are displayed.
* <code>http:<span></span>//pics.jonathancross.com/**list**/pics/1976/</code> - List mode (just like default above).
* <code>http:<span></span>//pics.jonathancross.com/**thumb**/pics/1976/</code> - Thumbnail mode (less words, bigger pictures).
* <code>http:<span></span>//pics.jonathancross.com/**single**/pics/1976/cat.jpg</code> - Single image display.
* <code>http:<span></span>//pics.jonathancross.com/**slide**/pics/1976/cat.jpg</code> - Begin slideshow starting with "cat.jpg".

##### Short URLs:
You can use the special `/go/` url to redirect to any folder in the system.  Supports fuzzy matching, no explicit definition of URLs is necessary.  See [#29](https://github.com/jonathancross/pics.jonathancross.com/issues/29) for more info.
Examples:
* http://jac.pics/go/india
* http://jac.pics/go/albania
* http://jac.pics/go/2015

#### Database structure:
JCDSee generates a very basic flat-file database in each folder named `.jcdsee`.  This file is a pipe-delineated file with this format:

    filename.jpg|Optional HTML description of the file.  

Fancy file name support:
* <code>**2015-08-13**_This-is-the-day.jpg</code> - Date prefix will be understood by the software and displayed differently to visitors.
* <code>**99**_Almost_number_100.png</code> - Simple number prefixes (used to set order, etc) will be hidden from website visitors.
* <code>El Ni**Ã±**o.jpg</code> - Spaces and UTF8 characters in file names are okay.

#### Warnings:
* Do not host user-supplied images, files, etc. JCDSee is intended to be used for content you created and are sure is safe.
* The software requires all files to be in a folder called "pics".
* The system tries to prevent unauthorized access to files and folders, but needs more testing.
* Does not use SQL, cookies, sessions, etc.
* On pics.jonathancross.com I use an admin script to automate many tasks (editing database, building the sitemap, etc). Althought the admin script is [now available on GitHub](jcdsee/admin/index.cgi), it requires additional scripts to work properly.

### Debugging

#### Commandline debugging:
You can use this script from the shell to generate thumbnails, create the `.jcdsee` database files, debug problems, etc:

    ./jcdsee.cgi debug <directory> <display_mode> <pic_cur_idx>
All arguments in `<>` are optional.

##### URL parameters (DEPRECATED):
URL Parameters have been deprecated as part of the "[Better URLs](https://github.com/jonathancross/pics.jonathancross.com/milestones/Better%20URLs)" upgrade.  Ignore this section if using `mod_rewrite`.  If you are using URL parameters, they should still work, but the app will respond with clean-urls by default. Support for params may be removed in future versions, but for now these are your two options:
* `display_mode=[list|thumb|single|slide]` - defaults to `list` mode.
* `pic_path=/path/to/picture.jpg` - link to a single folder or picture.
